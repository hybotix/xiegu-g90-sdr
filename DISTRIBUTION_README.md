## 🚀 Quick Start for End Users

### 1. Clone or Download

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/G90-SDR.git
cd G90-SDR
```

**Or download ZIP:**
- Download and extract to any location
- We'll call this `G90-SDR/` directory

### 2. Set Installation Path

```bash
# Add to ~/.bashrc
echo "export L_SDR_DIR=$HOME/G90-SDR" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Note:** Users can install anywhere! Change path as needed:
- `$HOME/G90-SDR`
- `$HOME/Virtual/G90-SDR`
- `$HOME/Documents/G90-SDR`
- `/opt/G90-SDR` (system-wide)

### 3. Run Installation

```bash
cd $L_SDR_DIR
bash install.bash
```

This installs:
- System dependencies
- FlRig (compiles from source)
- SDR++ (compiles from source)
- Python environment
- All required packages

**Time:** 20-30 minutes on Raspberry Pi 5

### 4. Install Universal Launchers

```bash
# Create desktop launchers
bash create_universal_launchers.bash

# Install system wrappers (needs sudo)
sudo bash install_wrappers.bash
```

### 5. Reboot (Required)

```bash
sudo reboot
```

Group membership changes require reboot.

### 6. Test Installation

```bash
cd $L_SDR_DIR
source venv/bin/activate
python3 tests/TestConnection.py
python3 tests/DiagnoseSystem.py
```

### 7. Launch!

**From Applications Menu:**
- Look for "G90-SDR System" or "FlRig for G90"

**From Terminal:**
```bash
g90-sdr
```

## 📤 Distribution Methods

### Method 1: GitHub Repository (Recommended)

**Setup:**
```bash
cd G90-SDR
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - G90-SDR v1.0"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/G90-SDR.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Users can then:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/G90-SDR.git
```

### Method 2: Archive Download

**Create release archive:**
```bash
cd ~
tar -czf G90-SDR-v1.0.tar.gz \
    --exclude='G90-SDR/venv' \
    --exclude='G90-SDR/logs/*.log' \
    --exclude='G90-SDR/__pycache__' \
    G90-SDR/
```

**Users download and extract:**
```bash
tar -xzf G90-SDR-v1.0.tar.gz
cd G90-SDR
```

### Method 3: Direct Sharing (USB, etc.)

Copy entire `G90-SDR/` directory to USB drive or share via file transfer.
